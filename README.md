# Python codes accompanying manuscript "Estimating the renewables pull in future global green value chains"

These Python codes reproduce results presented in an accompanying manuscript on estimations of the renewables pull in future global green value chains. It determines energy-cost savings and other relocation penalties based for different import scenarios for the green value chains of steel, urea, and ethylene.
