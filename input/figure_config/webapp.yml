    "The levelised cost of production is shown for (panels left to right) steel, urea, and ethylene for four different 
    import cases (as defined in Fig. 2) in year 2050. The cost is calculated using techno-economic data as well as an 
    assumption of an electricity price of 50 EUR/MWh in the importing and 15 EUR/MWh in the exporting region and some 
    cost reduction of CAPEX compared to today's values due to learning effects, with further details outlined in 
    Methods. Moreover, Case 1A shows high transportation cost of 90 EUR/MWh, whereas Case 1B shows moderate cost for 
    hydrogen transportation of 20 EUR/MWh. The result shows clear and substantial cost-reduction for relocating 
    production to regions with cheap RE for all cases except Case 1A, as indicated by the arrows showing the relative 
    and absolute cost differences of Cases 1–3 compared to the Base Case."

    "Shown is the levelised cost of production of individual process steps along the value chain of the studied 
    energy-intensive goods for the Base Case. Clearly, electrolysis for the production of H₂ and DAC for the winning of 
    CO₂ from the atmosphere are the most energy-intensive steps in all value chains. However, a significant share of 
    energy demand remains in all other processes, especially in the EAF."

    difference. The secondary Y-Axes show the production-cost difference relative to the total production cost in the 
    Base Case. Bottom: Heatmap show the production cost difference as a function of both electricity-price difference 
    and H₂ transportation cost for Case 1, with the red line showing the default assumption for Case 1B from the top. 
    The dashed line indicates the electricity-price difference for the default assumptions used to produce the data in
