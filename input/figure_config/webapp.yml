    "The levelised cost of production is shown for (panels left to right) steel, urea, and ethylene for four  different 
    import cases (as defined in Fig. 2) in year 2050. The cost is calculated using techno-economic data, as well as an 
    assumption of an electricity price of 50 EUR/MWh in the importing and 15 EUR/MWh in the exporting region, moderate 
    cost for hydrogen transportation of 30 EUR/MWh, and some cost reduction of CAPEX compared to today's values due to 
    learning effects, with further details outlined in Methods. The result shows clear and substantial cost-reduction 
    for relocating production to regions with cheap RE, as indicated by the arrows showing relative and absolute cost 
    reduction of Cases 1–3 compared to the Base Case."

    "Shown is the levelised cost of production of individual process steps along the value chain of the studied 
    energy-intensive goods for the Base Case. Clearly, electrolysis for the production of H₂ and DAC for the winning of 
    CO₂ from the atmosphere are the most energy-intensive steps in all value chains. However, a significant share of 
    energy demand remains in all other processes, especially in the EAF."
