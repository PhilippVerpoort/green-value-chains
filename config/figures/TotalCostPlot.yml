  title: Relocation savings for the different import and electricity-price cases.
  desc:
    'Top row: Production cost relative to Base Case for the import cases from Fig. 3 (including subcases A/B for Case 
    1) and electricity-price cases in Tab. 1. Bottom row: Comparison between the renewables pull, i.e. energy-cost 
    savings, on the lower axis and transport and financing penalties on the upper axis, with the heatmap showing the 
    resulting relocation savings relative to the Base Case. Case 1A is displayed separately from the other cases and 
    not included in the corridor of values on the top row to highlight its saliency and contrast it with the otherwise 
    monotonous decrease of production cost with increasing depth of relocation.'
