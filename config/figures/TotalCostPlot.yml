    'Top row: Relocation savings, i.e. overall production-cost savings, relative to the Base Case production cost, 
     shown for the import cases outlined in Fig. 3 and electricity-price cases in Tab. 1. Bottom row: Comparison 
     between the renewables pull, i.e. energy-cost savings, on the lower axis and transport and financing penalties on 
     the upper axis with the heatmap showing the resulting relocation savings relative to the Base Case for the 
     medium-pull electricity-price case. Case 1A is displayed separately from the other cases and not included in the 
     corridor of values on the top row to highlight its saliency and contrast it to the otherwise monotonous decrease 
     of production cost with increasing degree of relocation. The bottom row shows how the penalties cause Case 1A to 
     have higher production cost compared to the Base Case for an electricity-price difference below approx. 35 
     EUR/MWh.'
