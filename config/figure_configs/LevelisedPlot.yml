  title: Levelised production cost of selected commodities.
  desc:
    'The levelised cost of production is shown for (panels left to right) steel, urea, and ethylene for 
    four different import cases (as defined in Fig. 2) in year 2040. The cost is calculated using 
    techno-economic data as well as an assumption of an electricity price of 50 EUR/MWh in the 
    importing and 15 EUR/MWh in the exporting region and some cost reduction of CAPEX compared to 
    Methods. Moreover, Case 1A shows high transportation cost of 90 EUR/MWh, whereas Case 1B shows 
    moderate cost for hydrogen transportation of 20 EUR/MWh. The result shows clear and substantial 
    cost-reduction for relocating production to regions with cheap RE for all cases except Case 1A, as 
    indicated by the arrows showing the relative and absolute cost differences of Cases 1â€“3 compared to 
    the Base Case.'
